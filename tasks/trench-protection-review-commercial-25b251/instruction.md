# Trench protection review (commercial project)

You are assessing real trade work the way a competent tradesperson or inspector would.
Read the situation below and write your conclusions to `/app/answer.json`.

## Context

- Setting: a commercial construction project governed by building codes, submittals, and third-party inspections
- Trade: Sitework & Utilities
- Scope under review: Trench protection
- Your task: spot the unsafe conditions and state the immediate controls required
- Stage of the work when observed: `in-progress` (actively in progress)
- Component condition categories that may apply: none flagged — judge from the evidence

## Scenario

A 6-foot-deep utility trench has workers inside a trench shield whose certification plate and tabulated data are visible. Shield walls extend above grade, the spoil pile sits roughly four feet back from the edge, and an extension ladder inside the shield extends three rungs above grade about ten feet from the workers. A competent-person daily inspection log dated today is shown.

## Task

Identify any hazards requiring immediate control, or confirm the protective system is adequate as observed.

## Required output

Write valid JSON to `/app/answer.json` with this shape:

```json
{
  "decision": "pass | fail | needs_more_info",
  "risk": "low | medium | high | critical",
  "work_stage": "planned | staged | in-progress | rough-complete | tested/inspected | rework | accepted | in-service",
  "component_conditions": ["installed-defective", "non-compliant", "worn", "degraded", "failed"],
  "percent_complete": 0,
  "value": 0,
  "sound_source": "component or source of the sound, when asked",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "event_time": 0.0,
  "rate": 0.0,
  "order": ["step-id", "..."],
  "workable": ["activity ID", "..."],
  "findings": ["short defect or hazard finding", "..."],
  "actions": ["immediate corrective action", "..."],
  "rationale": "brief explanation",
  "references": ["code or standard anchors you relied on"]
}
```

Do not write prose outside the JSON file. If the work is dangerous or non-compliant, `decision` must be `fail`.
`work_stage` is how far the work has progressed; `percent_complete` is your numeric estimate of overall progress.
`component_conditions` lists the condition categories that apply to the component; use an empty list if none apply.
Use `value` for the numeric reading or computed quantity when the task asks for one.
Use `sound_source`, `event_time`, `rate`, and `order` for audio/video-native tasks when requested.
Use `workable` for a list of activity IDs when the task asks what work can still start.

## Reference material

Apply these to the scenario rather than quoting them mechanically.
