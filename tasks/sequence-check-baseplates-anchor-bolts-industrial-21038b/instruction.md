# Sequence check: Baseplates & anchor bolts (industrial site)

You are assessing real trade work the way a competent tradesperson or inspector would.
Read the situation below and write your conclusions to `/app/answer.json`.

## Context

- Setting: a heavy-industrial construction or process site where work follows engineered drawings, specifications, and permits
- Trade: Equipment & Machinery
- Scope under review: Baseplates & anchor bolts
- Your task: check the order of the work and catch any sequence violation
- Stage of the work when observed: `in-progress` (actively in progress)
- Component condition categories that may apply: none flagged — judge from the evidence

## Scenario

The crew log for Baseplates & anchor bolts shows the required preparatory steps finished before the current operation. Hold points are signed, materials are staged in order, and no skipped step is visible in the photo set. Reference material on hand: API RP 686.

## Task

Evaluate the described field condition and return the appropriate decision with supporting observations.

## Required output

Write valid JSON to `/app/answer.json` with this shape:

```json
{
  "decision": "pass | fail | needs_more_info",
  "risk": "low | medium | high | critical",
  "work_stage": "planned | staged | in-progress | rough-complete | tested/inspected | rework | accepted | in-service",
  "component_conditions": ["installed-defective", "non-compliant", "worn", "degraded", "failed"],
  "percent_complete": 0,
  "value": 0,
  "sound_source": "component or source of the sound, when asked",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "event_time": 0.0,
  "rate": 0.0,
  "order": ["step-id", "..."],
  "workable": ["activity ID", "..."],
  "findings": ["short defect or hazard finding", "..."],
  "actions": ["immediate corrective action", "..."],
  "rationale": "brief explanation",
  "references": ["code or standard anchors you relied on"]
}
```

Do not write prose outside the JSON file. If the work is dangerous or non-compliant, `decision` must be `fail`.
`work_stage` is how far the work has progressed; `percent_complete` is your numeric estimate of overall progress.
`component_conditions` lists the condition categories that apply to the component; use an empty list if none apply.
Use `value` for the numeric reading or computed quantity when the task asks for one.
Use `sound_source`, `event_time`, `rate`, and `order` for audio/video-native tasks when requested.
Use `workable` for a list of activity IDs when the task asks what work can still start.

## Reference material

Apply these to the scenario rather than quoting them mechanically.
