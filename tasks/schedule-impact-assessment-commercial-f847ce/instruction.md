# Schedule impact assessment (photo, commercial project)

You are assessing real trade work the way a competent tradesperson or inspector would.
Read the situation below and write your conclusions to `/app/answer.json`.

## Context

- Setting: a commercial construction project governed by building codes, submittals, and third-party inspections
- Trade: Carpentry & Finishes
- Scope under review: Schedule & constraint reasoning
- Your task: decide what work can proceed, what is blocked, and what recovery plan is valid
- Stage of the work when observed: `in-progress` (actively in progress)
- Component condition categories that may apply: none flagged — judge from the evidence

## Scenario

The image shows the current lookahead schedule with early-start bars, durations, and predecessor lists, plus a disruption note at the bottom.

## Media

- `/app/media/cpm_delay_001.png` (image)

## Task

Read the schedule and the disruption from the image. Report the project finish delay in workdays in the `value` field (0 if the float absorbs it), state whether the completion date slips, and identify what drives your answer.

## Required output

Write valid JSON to `/app/answer.json` with this shape:

```json
{
  "decision": "pass | fail | needs_more_info",
  "risk": "low | medium | high | critical",
  "work_stage": "planned | staged | in-progress | rough-complete | tested/inspected | rework | accepted | in-service",
  "component_conditions": ["installed-defective", "non-compliant", "worn", "degraded", "failed"],
  "percent_complete": 0,
  "value": 0,
  "sound_source": "component or source of the sound, when asked",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "event_time": 0.0,
  "rate": 0.0,
  "order": ["step-id", "..."],
  "workable": ["activity ID", "..."],
  "findings": ["short defect or hazard finding", "..."],
  "actions": ["immediate corrective action", "..."],
  "rationale": "brief explanation",
  "references": ["code or standard anchors you relied on"]
}
```

Do not write prose outside the JSON file. If the work is dangerous or non-compliant, `decision` must be `fail`.
`work_stage` is how far the work has progressed; `percent_complete` is your numeric estimate of overall progress.
`component_conditions` lists the condition categories that apply to the component; use an empty list if none apply.
Use `value` for the numeric reading or computed quantity when the task asks for one.
Use `sound_source`, `event_time`, `rate`, and `order` for audio/video-native tasks when requested.
Use `workable` for a list of activity IDs when the task asks what work can still start.
